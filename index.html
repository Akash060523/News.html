				<h2>31 runs in 1 Over! MI Pacer Arjun Tendulkar Becomes Part Of Unwanted Tally</h2>
				<img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-04/h2ckjlvg_arjun-tendulkar-bcci-ipl_625x300_22_April_23.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605">
				<div class="articlecontent">
				<p>Mumbai Indians youngster Arjun Tendulkar picked up his first wicket in front of the home crowd against Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 at Wankhede Stadium on Saturday, however, he also ended up featuring in an unwanted record. Arjun conceded 31 runs in the 16th over and with that over he bowled the second most expensive over by an MI bowler in the IPL. Daniel Sams holds the first position as he conceded 35 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2022. For the third position, there is a tie between three players as Pawan Suyal against Royal Challengers Bangalore (2014), Alzarri Joseph against Rajasthan Royals (2019) and Mitchell McClenaghan vs PBKS (2017) had conceded 28 runs each.
				   Arjun's over turned out to be crucial in Saturday's match as it shifted the momentum in favour of Punjab Kings.

                   PBKS got to a flying start even though they lost the wicket of Matthew Short (11) quite early in the innings. The talented duo of Indian youngsters Prabhsimran Singh and Atharva Taide played some beautiful shots that kept the PBKS scoreboard ticking. PBKS crossed the 50-run mark in 5.3 overs. At the end of six overs, PBKS end the powerplay at 58/1 with Prabhsimran Singh (25*) and Atharva Taide (19*) unbeaten.

                   However, Mumbai orchestrated Punjab's downfall in the middle overs as Arjun Tendulkar stepped up and picked up his first wicket in front of the home crowd. The young pacer trapped Prabhsimran Singh (25) right in front of the stumps with a yorker. Piyush Chawla followed up quickly to give control of the match to MI. Atharva Taide was dismissed by Chawla for a score of 29 (17).

                   PBKS managed to put up a score of 83/4 in 10 overs, with Sam Curran (0*) and Harpreet Singh Bhatia (1*) unbeaten on the crease.

                   Sam Curran and Harpreet started to set up a counterattack as PBKS slowly crossed the 100-run mark in 13.4 overs.
                   Curran and Harpreet picked the youngster Arjun Tendulkar as their target in the 16th over. Arjun conceded six boundaries in his over and he ended up conceding 31 runs which allowed PBKS to set their eyes on 200 plus total. Both batters displayed confidence in their batting and MI bowlers started to leak runs all over the field. This over became the turning point of the entire match.

				<h3> Virat Kholi returned as Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper for the match against Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) last time around, with full-time skipper Faf du Plessis deciding to become an 'Impact Player' due to a small injury problem. As the Bengaluru franchise takes on Rajasthan Royals in the first match of the double-header on Sunday, it would be interesting to see if a similar approach is opted for by RCB. Du Plessis and Kohli did the bulk of the scoring with the bat against PBKS but the franchise needs other batters to step up to, especially aginst an in-form side like the Royals.

                    Virat Kohli returned as Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper for the match against Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) last time around, with full-time skipper Faf du Plessis deciding to become an 'Impact Player' due to a small injury problem. As the Bengaluru franchise takes on Rajasthan Royals in the first match of the double-header on Sunday, it would be interesting to see if a similar approach is opted for by RCB. Du Plessis and Kohli did the bulk of the scoring with the bat against PBKS but the franchise needs other batters to step up to, especially aginst an in-form side like the Royals.<br>


                    RCB boast of one of IPL's most fearsome opening pairs in du Plessis and Kohli. The two are in form this season, handing RCB terrific starts.<br>

                     They have so far raised two century stands (148-run partnership against Mumbai Indians, 137 against Punjab Kings), besides adding 44 and 42 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals, respectively.<br>

                    In the process, both du Plessis and Kohli have smashed four half-centuries each.<br>

                    However, Kohli would like to strike at a better rate.<br>

                    Glenn Maxwell, too, has shown his hitting prowess in the tournament but has not been consistent enough. RCB would also be looking up to the likes of veteran Dinesh Karthik, Mahipal Lomlor, Shahbaz Ahmed and Suyash Prabhudessai in the middle-order.<br>

                    RCB's bowling attack is in the safe hands of Mohammed Siraj, who has been in sensational form, picking up 12 wickets from six games, including a four for 21 in their last match.<br>

                    Siraj is being ably supported by Wayne Parnell and Harshal Patel, who have picked up eight wickets apiece from four and six games, respectively. But both these bowlers have been a tad expensive and they would look to address this concern in the coming matches.<br>

                    RCB's spin department is spearheaded by Sri Lankan Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva, who looked impressive in his three outings so far.<br>
                    RCB likely playing XI against RR:Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik, Shahbaz Ahmed, Wanindu Hasaranga, Suyash Prabhudessai, Harshal Patel, Wayne Parnell, Mohammed Siraj<br>

				<h2>Northeastern Spain on the verge of 'drought emergency', Catalonia limits water use
                <p>Authorities issued a warning on Tuesday, stating that unless rain predictions improve, the area will experience a "drought emergency" in September. The usage of water would be subject to considerably stricter limitations.
					Northeastern Spain is currently experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades, with Barcelona facing a severe water crisis. The 7.7 million people who live in Catalonia, which is in the northeast of Spain, are dealing with the repercussions of a 32-month drought. Barcelona, where reservoirs are currently empty, is severely affected by the lack of rain.
					Authorities issued a warning on Tuesday, stating that unless rain predictions improve, the area will experience a "drought emergency" in September. The usage of water would be subject to considerably stricter limitations.
                    "At this point, it's the worst problem we're facing," said Catalan leader Pere Aragones, lamenting one of "the worst droughts in 50 years", reported Euro news. 

                    The Ter-Llobregat river system provides water to Barcelona, Girona, and other nearby towns and villages. According to the government of Spain, Catalonia's reservoirs and others have lost 27% of their original capacity. 

                    The Guadalquivir river basin in southern Andalusia, whose reservoirs are only 26 per cent full, is the only area in Spain that is worse.

				<h2>Canada: Around 150,000 public employees to go on strike over pay dispute</h2>
				<p>Canadian history will witness one of the biggest government employee strikes on Wednesday (April 19), as a result of failed negotiations with a public sector union. The final deadline of 9 p.m. in the talks between the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) and the Treasury Board of Canada, which hires government employees, passed without a resolution. Around 155,000 federal workers will go on strike on Wednesday at midnight, according to PSAC.

                    âWe truly hoped we wouldnât be forced to take strike action, but weâve exhausted every other avenue to reach a fair contract for Canadaâs Federal Public Service workers,â PSAC national president Chris Aylward.

                    One of the services that will be affected is immigration, which will have an impact on applicants for temporary work permits, permanent residency, and study permits for prospective overseas students. The largest country cohort for these categories consists of Indian nationals.

				<h2>Satellite images show China increasing construction on new Antarctic station</h2>
				<p>A Washington-based think tank has gathered information based on new satellite imagery, which suggests that construction has resumed for the first time since 2018 on China's fifth station in the southern polar region. 

                    The report released on Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) showed that China is making "significant progress" in Antarctica after a several years-long gap in construction. 
                    
                    China wants to develop new shipping routes in the Arctic and further expand its research in Antarctica, and in doing so, it is not alone as countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Korea have research stations in the region. 
                    
                    But Western governments have raised concerns over China's increasing presence in the polar regions, which could provide the People's Liberation Army (PLA) with better surveillance capabilities.

				<h2>'If given lesser punishmentâ¦' What Surat court said while rejecting Rahul Gandhi's plea</h2>
				<img src="https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/04/20/600x338/ANI-20230420050-0_1681982516452_1681982804544.jpg">

				<h1>A Surat court dismissed the application filed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in which he had sought a stay on his conviction in the 2019 criminal defamation case on the 'Modi surname' remark, on Thursday. (ANI)</h1>
				<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's plea for stay on a defamation conviction that prompted his expulsion from parliament last month. The 52 year old former MP of Wayanad was accused of insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surname during a rally in 2019. 

					The remarks made by Gandhi were seen as insulting PM Modi and those sharing his surname, some of them being fugitives, who stole money from the country. Rahul Gandhi during the election rally in Kolar in 2019 had remarked "all thieves have Modi surname". 
					Notably, the Narendra Modi led government has been accused of using the law to silence the Opposition and their critics. Critics highlight that the defamation conviction came after Gandhi repeatedly raised the issue of Modi's relationship with business tycoon Gautam Adani both inside and outside parliament.

					The Surat court judge produced a 27 page judgement dismissing Gandhi's plea. 
					
					"An application Exh.5 - preferred by Appellant Mr Rahul Gandhi u/s.389 and 389(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for staying the conviction imposed by the judgment and order dated 23/3/2023 by the Ld Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat in Criminal Case No.18712/2019 is hereby dismissed. Pronounced in open court today on this 20th April, 2023 at Surat," the order read. 
					
					On Thursday, Judge RP Mogera went through all the papers of the appeal in the case. He then said, "application dismissed". The additional Sessions Judge Robin Mogera refused to stay the conviction.
					
					Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, Rahul Gandhi has ben sentenced to two years of jail time, and will remain disqualified as MP for the next six years. 
					
					The complaint against Gandhi was filed by BJP MLA and former Gujarat minister Purnesh Modi.
					
					In his first reaction to the Surat court's verdict, Gandhi quoted Mahatma Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi about truth and non-violence.
					
					"My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth is my God, non-violence the means to get it. -- Mahatma Gandhi,'' the Congress leader tweeted.
					
					Here is what Mogera said while dismissing the plea
					-"Although the accused was warned and advised by the supreme court, there is no evidence of any change in his conduct."
					
					-"The accused is an MP who addresses the people in the capacity of an MP and impacts a large part of society, therefore the effect of this crime is much comprehensive in this case."
					
					-"If the accused is given lesser punishment, it will send a wrong message to the public and the purpose of defamation (law) is not fulfilled and slandering will become easy."

				<h2>Amazon launches program to identify and track counterfeiters</h2>

				<div class="articlecontent">
				<p>Amazon has launched its Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange (ACX), an initiative to help retail stores label and track marketplace counterfeits as part of the e-commerce giant's efforts to crack down on organized crime on its platform, the company announced on Thursday.
				 in the United States including Amazon face hurdles in keeping counterfeiters off their platforms and fake merchandise from entering their warehouses. The new program mimics data exchange programs by the credit card industry to find scammers and identify their tactics.
                Stores and marketplace sellers can anonymously contribute information and records flagging counterfeiters to a third-party database or use the database to avoid doing business with the bad actors.

				"We think it is critical to share information about confirmed counterfeiters to help the entire industry stop these criminals earlier," Dharmesh Mehta, Amazonâs vice president of selling partner services, said in a statement.
				
				The Seattle-based retail giant piloted the anti-counterfeiting initiative in 2021 with an undisclosed number of apparel, home goods and cosmetics stores, where counterfeiting is most common.
				
				As part of other anti-counterfeiting efforts, Amazon is also working with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on a data pilot that helps the company identify and target low-value e-commerce shipments that may be counterfeit goods or break other regulations.

				<h2>Tesla Earnings Dented by Price Cuts</h2>
				<img src="https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/04/20/600x338/US-TESLA-ANNOUNCES-NEW-PRICE-CUTS-AHEAD-OF-EARNING_1682001177654_1682001177829.jpg">
				<div class="articlecontent">
				<h3>SCHAUMBURG, ILLINOIS - APRIL 19: A sign marks the location of a Tesla dealership on April 19, 2023 in Schaumburg, Illinois. Tesla announced price cuts for its Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles in front of their 1st quarter earnings report due out today.<br> 
					Tesla Inc. felt the pain of a recent wave of price cuts, as a reduction in the average price of its cars contributed to a 24% decline in first-quarter profit.<br>
					Elon Muskâs electric-vehicle maker has lowered prices for models in the U.S. by between 14% and 25% this year as it contends with weaker demand, higher interest rates and burgeoning competition. The latest round of reductions came on the eve of earnings.<br>
					
					âWeâve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin," Mr. Musk, Teslaâs chief executive, said Wednesday on an earnings call, adding that he expects to be able to harvest additional software revenue down the line.Teslas sold for an average of around $46,000 in the first quarter, less than the company had forecast and down from some $52,200 in the first three months of 2022.
				
					Those price reductions jolted sales, at least initially, and orders are now âin excess of production," Mr. Musk said.<br>
                    
					But lower prices weighed on first-quarter profit, which fell to $2.5 billion, down from $3.3 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 24% from the year before to $23.3 billion, as Tesla delivered more cars to customers.<br>

                    Teslaâs operating margin, a measure of profitability, took a hit, falling to 11.4% from 19.2% in the first three months of 2022. Teslaâs margin remains among the highest in the auto industry. Ford Motor Co.âs operating margin was around 4% in 2022, and General Motors Co.âs was around 6.6%, according to FactSet.<br>

                    Teslaâs commitment to growth over profit is testing investorsâ patience.<br>

                    Teslaâs stock, which closed Wednesday at $180.59, is up nearly 50% this year. But it is trading at less than half of its peak value. Shares fell around 7% in offhours trading.<br>

				<h2>How ChatGPT helped this student get 94% in his exam without attending classes</h2>
				<img src="https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/04/19/600x338/EU-CHATGPT--0_1681868739127_1681868788868.JPG"			
				<div class="articlecontent">
			    <p>OpenAI's viral chatbot ChatGPT has been the subject of much debate since its launch in November last year. Now, to add fuel to the debate, this student used the chatbot to complete 12 weeks of study in just 2-3 hours, resulting in a score of 94 on his exam.

					On the popular social media platform Reddit, a user with the handle u/151N recently shared the story. In the post, the user expressed their concern about upcoming semester exams, as they had spent a significant amount of time inside their room instead of attending classes.
					The innovative solution they came up with was to use ChatGPT as a tutor to understand the major topics for the exam and focus their time on those specific topics.

					The student started by getting a transcript of all of their lectures and pasting it into ChatGPT asking the chatbot to analyze the lectures and use its algorithms to decide the information that would be most relevant for the upcoming exam. 
					
					However, the user encountered a small problem during the process when the transcript proved to be too long for ChatGPT to analyze. To overcome this, u/151N employed an online paraphrasing tool to summarize the text before submitting it to ChatGPT once more with the same request and the chatbot didn't disappoint.
					
					On the first day of exam preparation, u/151N was able to enlist important points from all the lectures and discussions conducted throughout the semester in just 4-5 hours.
					
					On the second day of preparation, u/151N asked ChatGPT to find all the points marked as important in each lecture, using only the course textbook and the transcript that the chatbot had previously summarized. The user then spent 4-5 hours that day ensuring that the information provided by ChatGPT was accurate.</p>
